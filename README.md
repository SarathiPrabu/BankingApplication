# BankingSolution
This project has been created to complete a database assignment for my course. I chose to use the Visual Studio IDE to work on it as I find it fun and easy to use. I plan on continuing to work on this project and improve it over time. This is my first project to be uploaded to GitHub, and I am excited to see how it turns out. I look forward to learning new things and gaining valuable experience from this project.
